This project is a front-end web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to apply core web development concepts to build a responsive, interactive, and user-friendly website.

The project focuses on creating structured web pages, styling them professionally, and adding dynamic behavior using JavaScript to improve user experience and functionality.

This project demonstrates my understanding of fundamental front-end development principles and serves as a foundation for building more advanced web applications in the future.
